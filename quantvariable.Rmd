### Intro

In this section, we will explore the data collected from a quantitative variable, and learn how to describe and summarize the important features of its distribution. We will first learn how to display the distribution using graphs and then move on to discuss numerical measures.

To display data from one quantitative variable graphically, we can use either the histogram or the stemplot.

Load the data
```{r }
load("data/actor_2013.RData")
```

Get a quick summary
```{r }
summary(actor_age)
```
