```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Summarise data and make charts
A survey that asked 1,200 U.S. college students about their body perception also asked the following question:

"With whom do you find it easiest to make friends?" (opposite sex, same sex or no difference).

In this activity we will use the collected data to:

* learn how to tally our data into a table of counts and percents.
* learn how to produce a pie chart.

Load required dataset:
```{r }
load("data/friends.RData")
```

Get a summary table of the data:
```{r }
t = table(friends$Friends)
t
```
